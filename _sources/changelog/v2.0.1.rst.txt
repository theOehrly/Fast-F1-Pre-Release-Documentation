Integration of a newer version of Ax6's old repository

This integrates a more recent version of the old repository.
See Issue #1

- Possibly breaking changes
  - :mod:`fastf1.plotting`: access to team colors changed

    use new function :func:`fastf1.plotting.team_color`

  - :mod:`fastf1.core.Laps`: :func:`pick_driver_number` and :func:`pick_driver_numbers` have been removed.

    :func:`fastf1.core.Laps.pick_driver` and :func:`fastf1.core.Laps.pick_drivers` do now accept driver numbers a drivers'
    three letter identifiers. Number and letter identifiers can be mixed in a single function call.

- Changes:

  - An error that previously resulted in the loading of laps failing completely is now handled slightly better.
    Data loading will now only fail for a driver which is actually concerned by this error and not for all drivers.

    See: https://github.com/theOehrly/Fast-F1/issues/1#issuecomment-670712178
    This still needs to be fixed properly at some point.

  - Fix crash if cache dir does not exist

  - Some under the hood cleanups and improvements

  - Somewhat improved documentation

- New:

  - :func:`fastf1.utils.delta_time` for comparing lost/gained time between two drivers

  - manual patch file for Bottas in testing
