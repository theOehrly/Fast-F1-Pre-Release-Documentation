v2.1.1
------

 Add support for recording and using live timing data

- Possibly breaking changes:

  - :meth:`fastf1.Session.load_laps`: Data will now be loaded without
    telemetry by default, i.e. only timing data is loaded.
    Telemetry data is usually not available anyways, therefore this prevents
    a confusing error.

- Changes:

  - Possibility to record live timing data
  - Possibility to use recorded live timing data as a data source
