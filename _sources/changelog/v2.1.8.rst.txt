 Add temporary support for sprint qualifying

- This release adds a temporary patch to support weekends with sprint
  sprint qualifying and their changed order of sessions.
  To get data for sprint qualifying, you can use the ``fastf1.get_session``
  function with the argument ``event='SQ'``.
  Also remember that FP2 is on a Saturday on these weekends. FP3 does
  not exist.
