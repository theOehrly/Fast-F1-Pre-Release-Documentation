v2.2.0
------

This release introduces a range of new features, bug fixes and improvements.
While backwards compatibility has been kept in mind, some breaking changes
are required.


Changes and New Features:

  - New :class:`fastf1.events.EventSchedule`: The event schedule provides
    information about session start times, event format, name and location of
    upcoming events as well as previous event. The schedule data for the
    current season is pulled from an external source that is updated regularly.
    This should solve issues caused by schedule changes during the seasons
    or even during a race weekend.

  - New :class:`fastf1.events.Event`: This object represents a single event
    and holds the same information as the event schedule, but for individual
    events.

  - New methods :meth:`fastf1.get_testing_session`,
    :meth:`fastf1.get_event`, :meth:`fastf1.get_testing_event` and
    :meth:`fastf1.get_event_schedule`

  - The cache now implements better automatic cache control and is used for
    all requests throughout FastF1.

  - The combination of improved caching and the implementation of the new
    event schedule now allow fastf1 to be used even if the Ergast API is not
    accessible. This improves reliability in case of temporary server or
    network problems.

  - Full offline support: Scripts can be run offline if they have been run
    at least once with an active internet connection and caching enabled.

  - Introduces the new objects :class:`fastf1.core.SessionResults` and
    :class:`fastf1.core.DriverResult`. These classes are built on top of
    :class:`pandas.DataFrame` and :class:`pandas.Series`. They provide
    information about all drivers that participated in a session.
    This information includes driver numbers, names, team names, finishing
    results, ...
    Session results are available for all sessions supported by the
    Ergast database.

  - A hard coded list of drivers is no longer required for testing sessions.
    This data can now be pulled from the api as well.

  - A more understandable error will be raised if properties of the
    :class:`~fastf1.core.Session` object are accessed which are not yet
    available because the relevant data has not been loaded.


Bug Fixes:

  - Fixed a bug that caused rain fall to always be true in weather data (#76)


Breaking Changes:

  - For **testing events**, :class:`fastf1.core.Session` objects can no longer be
    created through :func:`fastf1.get_session`. You need to use
    :func:`fastf1.get_testing_session` instead.

  - :attr:`fastf1.core.Session.date` is now a :class:`pandas.Timestamp`
    instead of a string.

  - The signature ``fastf1.core.Session.__init__(weekend, session_name)``
    has been changed to
    ``fastf1.core.Session.__init__(event, session_name)`` to adhere to
    new naming conventions. This is a breaking change if the arguments are
    given as keyword arguments.

  - :func:`fastf1.get_session` may return a different session now for some
    edge cases, if you load sessions by name instead of by round number.

  - The property :attr:`fastf1.core.Session.results` is now an instance of
    :class:`fastf1.core.SessionResults` instead of :class:`dict`. Most of the
    previously available data is accessible through the new data replacement
    object. Some special information like GPS coordinates and altitude are no
    longer available though. If you think that this data should still be
    provided by FastF1 in the future, please open an issue for that.

  - The datatype of the telemetry 'Brake' data channel is changed from
    ``int`` to ``bool``, as brake data was never actually more accurate
    than this. The representation as integer (percentage) values was
    misleading.


Deprecations:

  (Objects, methods and attributes deprecated in v2.2 will be removed
  in v2.3. Until then, accessing them will still work but a FutureWarning
  is shown, reminding you of the deprecation.)
  **Removal has been delayed for user convenience and because
  there exist no problems currently which make a removal immediately necessary.
  The new removal target is v3.0.0**


  - :class:`fastf1.core.Weekend` has been replaced with
    :class:`fastf1.events.Event`. All previously available methods and
    properties are implemented by the replacement object, although they have
    been partially deprecated.

  - The attributes ``name``, ``date`` and ``gp`` of
    :class:`fastf1.core.Weekend` have been deprecated.
    The replacement object :class:`fastf1.events.Event` subclasses
    :class:`pandas.Series`. The standard ways for accessing pandas Series'
    values should be used. The attributes have been additionally renamed in
    their Series representation.
    For example:

      - ``Weekend.name`` --> ``Event.EventName`` or ``Event['EventName']``
      - ``Weekend.date`` --> ``Event.EventDate`` or ``Event['EventDate']``
      - ``Weekend.gp`` --> ``Event.RoundNumber`` or ``Event['RoundNumber']``

  - The attribute :attr:`fastf1.core.Session.weekend` has been replaced by
    :attr:`fastf1.core.Session.event` to adhere to new naming conventions.

  - The function :func:`fastf1.core.get_round` has been deprecated and will be
    removed without replacement in v2.3. Use :func:`fastf1.get_event`
    instead and and get the round number from the returned event object.

  - :func:`fastf1.core.Session.load_laps` has been deprecated. Use
    :func:`fastf1.core.Session.load` instead, which offers more flexibility
    for deciding which data should be loaded. The new method will no longer
    return a :class:`~fastf1.core.Laps` object! You should access the
    :class:`~fastf1.core.Laps` object through
    :attr:`fastf1.core.Session.laps`

  - :class:`fastf1.core.Driver` has been replace with
    :class:`fastf1.core.DriverResult` which has a different signature.

  - The attributes ``grid``, ``position``, ``name``, ``familyname`` and
    ``team`` of :class:`fastf1.core.Driver` have been deprecated.
    The replacement object :class:`fastf1.core.DriverResult` subclasses
    :class:`pandas.Series`. The standard ways for accessing pandas Series'
    values should be used. The attributes have been additionally renamed in
    their Series representation.
    For example:

      - ``Driver.name`` --> ``DriverResult.FirstName`` or
        ``DriverResult['FirstName']``
      - ``Driver.familyname`` --> ``DriverResult.LastName`` or
        ``DriverResult['LastName']``
      - ``Driver.team`` --> ``DriverResult.TeamName`` or
        ``DriverResult['TeamName']``
      - ``Driver.grid`` --> ``DriverResult.GridPosition`` or
        ``DriverResult['GridPosition']``
      - ``Driver.position`` --> ``DriverResult.Position`` or
        ``DriverResult['Position']``
