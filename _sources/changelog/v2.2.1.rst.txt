v2.2.1
------

Changes:

  - Log ergast error tracebacks on level DEBUG instead of WARNING to avoid
    confusion when a failure was to be expected.

Bug Fixes:

  - Fixed: no session results for Verstappen (driver number 1 vs 33)
    (by @vlesierse)
  - Fixed: slicing telemetry by using multiple laps as a reference returns no
    data if some laps have NaT values for 'Time' or 'LapStartTime'
  - Fixed regression: Loading of livetiming no longer possible since v2.2.0 if
    recording does not contain a driver list
