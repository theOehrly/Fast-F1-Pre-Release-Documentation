v2.2.2
------

Changes:

  - Implement support for reading information about a drivers personal best
    lap from the api. :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_fastest` will now by
    default return the quickest lap that is also marked as personal best lap
    of any driver. This fixes the long standing problem that the fastest lap
    returned by this function may actually be a deleted lap.


Bug Fixes:

  - Fixed: data for the 2022 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix can not be loaded (#135)
  - Fixed: incorrect python version check in live timing client, that
    prevented running on actually supported versions of python (#132)
