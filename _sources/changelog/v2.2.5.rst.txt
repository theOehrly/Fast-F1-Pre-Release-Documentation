v2.2.5
------

Bug Fixes:

  - Fixed grid position, position and points missing from Sprint sessions
    result in 2022 (#166)


New Features:

  - Added :func:`fastf1.plotting.driver_color` to get driver colors which are
    similar to the team color but slightly different between both drivers of
    one team. This ways the drivers can be differentiated better.
