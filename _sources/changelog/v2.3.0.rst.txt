v2.3.0
------

Bug Fixes:

  - The matplotlib dependency version is now required to be >= 3.3.3 to prevent
    incompatibility. (#210)

  - Fixed: NaT values for 'Time' or 'LapStartTime' may cause a crash
    in :func:`fastf1.core.Telemetry.calculate_driver_ahead` (#151)

  - Fixed: Data for speed trap 'SpeedST' is added to the wrong lap.
    This additionally caused empty laps to exist for some drivers at the
    beginning of some sessions.

  - Fixed: :func:`fastf1.core.Telemetry.add_driver_ahead` could not
    be called on previously resampled telemetry data. (#178)

  - Added: Better error handling for sessions that did not take place.

  - Fixed: Tyre compound shown for some laps was incorrect in some special
    cases. (#204)

  - Fixed: Incorrect first and last name for Hulkenberg in fallback driver list
    (by @niallmcevoy)

  - Fixed: metadata for :class:`~fastf1.core.Telemetry` was not propagated
    correctly in :func:`fastf1.core.Telemetry.merge_channels` and
    :func:`fastf1.core.Telemetry.resample_channels`.

  - Fixed: incorrect call of scipy method in
    :func:`fastf1.legacy.inject_driver_ahead`

  - Fixed: Error handling regression in :func:`fastf1.core.Session.load`

  - Fixed: :exc:`~fastf1.core.DataNotLoadedError` not raised for `car_data` and
    `pos_data`.


New Features:

  - Added: Function :func:`fastf1.get_events_remaining` (by @oscr)

  - Added: Support for shorthand paths (e.g. '~/cache') in
    :func:`fastf1.Cache.enable_cache` (by @oscr)


Changes:

  - The default base url scheme for Ergast is changed from http to https.


Deprecations and Notices for Upcoming Changes:

  - Deprecation: Undocumented function :func:`fastf1.ergast.fetch_weekend`
    will be removed without a direct replacement in a future version
    (target: v3.0.0).

  - Change: :func:`fastf1.utils.to_timedelta` and
    :func:`fastf1.utils.to_datetime` will return `NaT` instead of raising and
    exception if a valued cannot be parsed in a future version
    (target: v3.0.0).
