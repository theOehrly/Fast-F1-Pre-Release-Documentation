What's new in v3.1.5
--------------------

(released 17/11/2023)

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed a bug that caused inconsistent behaviour in
  :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_fastest` in some cases were there was no lap
  that met the criteria for a fastest lap. Now, an empty
  :class:`~fastf1.core.Lap` object will always be returned when there is no
  fastest lap. (Note that this will change in the future, see 'Deprecations'
  below (#476) (by @Casper-Guo)

- Fixed a bug that prevented some sessions of the Las Vegas Grand Prix from
  being loaded (#481)

Deprecations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- In cases were no lap meets the criteria for a fastest lap,
  :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_fastest` currently returns an empty
  :class:`~fastf1.core.Lap` object. Starting from version 3.3, this will
  return ``None`` instead


What's new in v3.1.4
--------------------

(released 26/10/2023)

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed a bug that caused :func:`~fastf1.core.Telemetry.add_driver_ahead` to
  only work with telemetry data that matches the sampling timebase of the
  car data (#430)

- Improved robustness of the Ergast API parser to prevent crashes caused by some
  empty values in the API response (#433) (by @harningle)

- Fixed: some laps that were generated by FastF1 had incorrect lap numbers

- Fixed: pit out times from the lap onto the grid are no longer shown for the
  first lap of a race-like session. The first lap will only have a pit out time
  if a driver started from the pit lane or pitted on the formation lap.
  (#467) (by @Casper-Guo)

- Improved robustness of the 'f1timing' schedule backend to prevent a crash
  caused by partially incorrect data for the schedule of the Qatar GP

- Fixed: laps for all drivers were marked as inaccurate if the lap accuracy
  check could not be performed for one driver


New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added driver colors for VES, POU, HAD, DOO and BEA
  (#471) (by @pesaventofilippo)



What's new in v3.1.3
--------------------

(released 07/10/2023)

Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- fixed a bug in the driver list parser that caused Piastri to be missing from
  the results in the 2023 Qatar Sprint Shootout (#460)



What's new in v3.1.2
--------------------

(released 31/08/2023)

Bug Fixes

--------------------

(released 29/08/2023)


Hotfix to correct incorrect package definition that prevented import of FastF1.



What's new in v3.1.0
--------------------

(released 29/08/2023)

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Added additional circuit information that includes the location of corners,
  marshal lights, marshal sectors and the rotation of the track map. This
  data is available through :func:`fastf1.core.Session.get_circuit_info`. Also
  check out the new examples that show how to annotate your plots using this
  data.
  A huge thank you to @multiviewer (https://multiviewer.app/) for providing
  this information through MultiViewer's API.

- "SessionInfo" data from the F1 livetiming API is now available through
  :attr:`fastf1.core.Session.session_info`

- Added driver colors for Shwartzman and Lawson (by @pesaventofilippo) (#441)

- Various improvement to the ``Laps.pick_*`` methods to make it easier to select
  specific laps from :class:`~fastf1.core.Laps` (by @Casper-Guo) (#376).

  **New** (no equivalent has existed before)

  - :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_not_deleted` for selecting all laps that
    haven't been deleted

  **New** (these methods replace methods that only accepted single values; the
  new functions accept single values or lists of values)

  - :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_laps` for selecting one or multiple laps
    by their lap number; replaces :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_lap`

  - :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_drivers` for selecting laps from one or
    multiple drivers; replaces :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_driver`

  - :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_compounds` for selecting laps driven on one or
    multiple compounds; replaces :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_tyre`

  **Improved**

  - :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.pick_track_status` now has additional options for
    the ``how`` argument to exclude laps with a specific track status or match
    or exclude laps with one of multiple track status values.


Performance
^^^^^^^^^^^

- greatly improved speed when parsing car data and position data


Bug Fixes
^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed :func:`~fastf1.core.Laps.split_qualifying_sessions` returns
  incorrect result

- Fixed incorrect calculation of results for Qualifying-like sessions (#429)

- Fixed incorrect alignment of lap start/end times that causes shifted telemetry
  data when comparing laps and incorrect results for calculated grid positions
  (#440)

- Fixed an unhandled exception in the lap timing parser that made it impossible
  to load data for the 2020 Miami Qualifying (#431)

- Fixed incorrectly set lap start times after some red flag restarts

- Fixed a bug that could prevent data loading in case of partially missing data


Deprecations
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Deprecated :func:`fastf1.core.Laps.pick_lap`

- Deprecated :func:`fastf1.core.Laps.pick_driver`

- Deprecated :func:`fastf1.core.Laps.pick_tyre`


Other Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Fixed some errors in the documentation (by @dawiddzhafarov, @RyanHaniff)
  (#439, #402)

- Fixed some examples to no longer use deprecated arguments (by @wakamex) (#423)
