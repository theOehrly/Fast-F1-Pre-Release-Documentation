Thank you for your interest in helping to improve FastF1! There are various
ways to contribute to FastF1. All of them are super valuable but don't
necessarily require writing code at all. For example:

- contributing to the documentation
- opening new issues for bugs
- requesting new features
- asking for clarification on things you find unclear
- fixing bugs
- writing example scripts for the gallery
