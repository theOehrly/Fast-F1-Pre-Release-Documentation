Overlaying speed traces of two laps
======================================

Compare two fastest laps by overlaying their speed traces.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 6-21

.. code-block:: Python



    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    import fastf1.plotting


    # enable some matplotlib patches for plotting timedelta values and load
    # FastF1's default color scheme
    fastf1.plotting.setup_mpl(misc_mpl_mods=False)

    # load a session and its telemetry data
    session = fastf1.get_session(2021, 'Spanish Grand Prix', 'Q')
    session.load()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 22-23

First, we select the two laps that we want to compare

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 23-27

.. code-block:: Python


    ver_lap = session.laps.pick_driver('VER').pick_fastest()
    ham_lap = session.laps.pick_driver('HAM').pick_fastest()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 28-30

Next we get the telemetry data for each lap. We also add a 'Distance' column
to the telemetry dataframe as this makes it easier to compare the laps.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 30-34

.. code-block:: Python


    ver_tel = ver_lap.get_car_data().add_distance()
    ham_tel = ham_lap.get_car_data().add_distance()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 35-37

Finally, we create a plot and plot both speed traces.
We color the individual lines with the driver's team colors.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 37-53

.. code-block:: Python


    rbr_color = fastf1.plotting.team_color('RBR')
    mer_color = fastf1.plotting.team_color('MER')

    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(ver_tel['Distance'], ver_tel['Speed'], color=rbr_color, label='VER')
    ax.plot(ham_tel['Distance'], ham_tel['Speed'], color=mer_color, label='HAM')

    ax.set_xlabel('Distance in m')
    ax.set_ylabel('Speed in km/h')

    ax.legend()
    plt.suptitle(f"Fastest Lap Comparison \n "
                 f"{session.event['EventName']} {session.event.year} Qualifying")

    plt.show()
