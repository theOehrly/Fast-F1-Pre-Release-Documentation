FastF1 documentation
====================

For the passionate F1 nerds.


To get a quick overview over how to use FastF1, check out
:doc:`examples/index` or the :doc:`examples_gallery/index`.


Furthermore, there are some great articles and examples written by other people. They
provide a nice overview about what you can do with FastF1 and might help you
to get started.

Introduction
============

FastF1 gives you access to F1 lap timing, car telemetry and position,
tyre data, weather data, the event schedule and session results.

The module is designed around Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib. This makes it easy
to use while offering lots of possibilities for data analysis and
visualization.

FastF1 handles big chunks of data (~50-100mb per session). To improve performance
data is per default cached locally as requests (be aware). The default placement
of the cache is operating system specific. A custom location can be set if desired.
For more information see :class:`~fastf1.api.Cache`.

All data is downloaded from two sources:

    - The official f1 data stream ->
      `f1-live <https://www.formula1.com/en/f1-live.html>`_
    - Ergast web api -> `ergast.com <http://ergast.com/mrd/>`_

Have fun!


Installation
============

It is recommended to install FastF1 using pip:

    pip install fastf1

Note that Python 3.8 or higher is required.
(The live timing client does not support Python 3.10, therefore full
functionality is only available with Python 3.8 and 3.9)

Alternatively, a wheel or a source distribution can be downloaded from Pypi.

Available Data
==============

The following is a short overview over the available data with some references
to functions and objects used to work with this data.

- The event schedule for past seasons and the current season, including
  upcoming events. The schedule provides event names, countries, locations,
  dates, scheduled starting times and more.
  See :func:`fastf1.get_event_schedule`, :class:`~fastf1.events.EventSchedule`

  This data is also available for individual events.
  See :func:`fastf1.get_event`, :class:`~fastf1.events.Event`

- Driver information and session results, including driver names, team names,
  finishing and grid positions, points, and more.
  See :class:`~fastf1.core.SessionResults`, :class:`~fastf1.core.DriverResult`

- Lap timing data including sector times, lap times, pit stops, tyre data and
  more.
  See :class:`~fastf1.core.Laps`

- Telemetry data including speed, rpm, gear and more.
  See :class:`~fastf1.core.Telemetry`
