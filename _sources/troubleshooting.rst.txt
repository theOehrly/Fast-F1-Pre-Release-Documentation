Troubleshooting
=======================


Something doesn't work
=======================

1. Have you updated to the newest version of fastf1?

2. Clear the cache or run your script without cache enabled first if you don't want to clear it just for a test.
   If everything works when running without cache enabled, clear the cache and enable it again.

3. Does the log produce any warnings that sound like they might be related? Maybe the data you are looking for
   is not available or can not be processed correctly.

4. Open an issue on github.
